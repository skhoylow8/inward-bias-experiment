        <div class="page-box" id="consent-box">
            <div class="consent-instr">To conduct this experiment, we need to include this information sheet:</div>
            <div class="form-area">
                <strong>CONSENT FORM</strong><br /><br />
                You are invited to participate in a research study on human cognition, conducted by Hongjing
                Lu, PhD, of the Dept. of Psychology at UCLA. You were selected as a possible participant in
                this study because you have normal or corrected vision, and are 18 years of age or older. For
                scientific reasons, this consent form does not include complete information about the study
                hypotheses and the research questions being tested. You will be fully debriefed following your
                participation in the research.<br /><br />

                <strong>Purpose of Study</strong><br />
                The purpose of the study is to understand human perception and cognition.<br /><br />

                <strong>Procedures Involved in Study</strong><br />
                If you agree to participate, you may be presented with images, videos, or sounds on a computer
                screen, and answer simple questions and/or perform simple tasks by interacting with a website
                via a keyboard or a computer mouse. You may also be asked to fill out some questionnaires
                about your personality or experience, which will take at max 15 minutes. Your responses will be
                recorded by the computer and will not be identified with you in any way. You may receive a
                demographic questionnaire to collect information of your age, gender, ethnicity, and language.
                The session will take at most 60 minutes.<br /><br />

                <strong>Potential Risks and Discomforts</strong><br />
                There is no known risk/discomfort in this study. If you experience any discomfort during the
                course of the experiment, you can stop at any time and notify the experimenter.<br /><br />

                <strong>Potential Benefits to Subject</strong><br />
                There are no direct benefits from participating in this study.<br /><br />

                <strong>Potential Benefits to Society</strong><br />
                The findings of the study will help improve procedures for making important decisions to avoid
                unwanted biases. For example, individual’s cognitive tendencies may influence their decision
                making on finance, relationships, or diets, and their behaviors in different contexts like internet
                versus in-person interactions. By understanding how people differ from each other, we will be
                able to design better environments for people to make rational and just decisions in different
                domains in life.<br /><br />

                <strong>Payment for Participation</strong><br />
                You would receive 0.5 hour of credit every 30 minute for your psychology class if you signed up
                for the study through the UCLA Psychology Department Subject Pool; otherwise, you would
                receive the payment in the rate of $10 per hour for your participation.<br /><br />
                
                <strong>Confidentiality</strong><br />
                Your identity in this study will be treated as confidential. The results of the study, including
                laboratory or any other data, may be published for scientific purposes but will not include any
                identifiable references to you. The researchers will do their best to make sure that your private
                information is kept confidential. Information about you will be handled as confidentially as
                possible, but participating in research may involve a loss of privacy and the potential for a breach
                in confidentiality. Study data will be physically and electronically secured.  As with any use of
                electronic means to store data, there is a risk of breach of data security. Your data, including de-
                identified data may be kept for use in future research.
                <br /><br />
                Your IP Addresses may be collected to prevent the same IP address from participating twice.
                Your platform ID (e.g., Mturk worker ID, Prolific ID, or Sona ID) will not be shared with
                anyone outside of the research team and will not be linked to study responses. However, any
                work performed on MTurk can be linked to the user’s public profile page. Thus, you may wish to
                restrict what information you choose to share in your public profile.<br /><br />

                <strong>Participation and Withdraw</strong><br />
                Your participation is VOLUNTARY. You may withdraw from the experiment at any time
                without suffering any negative consequences.<br /><br />

                <strong>Identification of Investigators</strong><br />
                If you have any questions, feel free to contact Dr. Hongjing Lu (hongjing@ucla.edu), at the
                Department of Psychology, UCLA, 405 Hilgard Ave., Los Angeles, CA 90095-1563.<br /><br />

                <strong>Rights of Research Subjects</strong><br />
                You may withdraw your consent at any time and discontinue participation without penalty. You
                are not waiving any legal claims, rights or remedies because of your participation in this research
                study.<br /><br />

        <strong>Debriefing Sheet:</strong><br />
        <p style="font-size: 18px; padding-bottom: 5%;">
            <br />
            Whenever you pick up your phone to take a picture, you face an aesthetic task that 
            artists faced for thousands of years: How to frame a picture? Besides the famous rule 
            of thirds and golden ratio ideas, there is actually one very robust but undiscussed 
            preference: an inward bias. We like to frame an image in a way that makes the figure 
            in it face inward to the center of the image, leaving more space in its front than its
            back, rather than outward to the frame borders.
            <br /><br />
            What we want to know in this study is why this is the case. We suspect that this 
            preference has evolved to help us “frame” the world with our visual field--when we turn 
            our head to a particular direction to look at a certain object, we are effectively 
            “framing” the visual world. An inward bias can thus serve an addaptive function: leaving 
            more space in the front of the figure allows us to see what is going to happen next if 
            the figure moves, or is interacted with in the future (since most things tend to happen 
            in the front rather than in the back of a person or an object). To test this idea, we 
            measure your social tendency, which is associated with how readily you make predictions 
            about future movements of social agents, and measure its association with the extent of 
            your inward bias! 
            <br /><br />

            experiment.

            <strong>Here is some additional information about the bigger project this study is a part of:</strong><br />
            <br />
            We are studying human cognition by looking at how people differ in terms of personality, 
            cognitive tendencies, and skills. Here are a few example scientific questions we are looking at:
            <br />- Do people agree what looks pretty and what looks bad?
            <br />- How is one’s personality related to their judgement of social situations?
            <br />- Would cultural backgrounds influence memory of different objects?
            <br /><br />

            If you have any questions, please feel free to contact the researcher Hongjing Lu at hongjing@ucla.edu.
